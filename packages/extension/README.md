Once the build is running, you can install the extension in your browser of choice:

- [Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Opera instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest)
  - Note that these instructions are for Chrome, but substituting
    `brave://extensions` or `edge://extensions` or `opera://extensions` for `chrome://extensions`
    depending on browser should get you to the same buttons.
